OVERVIEW
--------

This library provides a Ruby interface to the Nmap Security Scanner and its
XML formatted scan data.  It can run Nmap and parse its XML output directly
from the scan, parse a file or string of XML scan data, or parse XML scan
data from an object via its read() method.  This information is presented in
an easy-to-use and intuitive fashion for further storage and manipulation.

Note that while Anthony Persaud's Perl Nmap::Parser was certainly an
inspiration when designing this library, there are a number of distinguishing
characteristics.  Very briefly, this library contains more classes, many more
methods, and has blocks extensively available.


REQUIREMENTS and RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------

Things Required:

* Nmap Security Scanner (http://nmap.org) [Only required for parsescan()]

* REXML Ruby Library [In standard library with Ruby >= 1.8]


Things Recommended:

* Ruby version >= 1.9.1, which is far faster than the 1.8 versions

* Open3 Ruby Library [In standard library; for parsescan()]


HELP
----

The website has detailed RDoc documentation available.  You can create a quick
set of these docs yourself by issuing the following command from the base
directory:

$ rdoc lib

A "doc" directory will be created.  Just point your browser to doc/index.html
